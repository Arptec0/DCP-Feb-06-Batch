		Introduction to DevOps
		Why DevOps ??
		
		SDLC Process ??
		Software 
		
		SDLC -- Software Development Life Cycle
		
		Develop a software Application :
					Desktop
					Web
					Mobile 
		
		Free-lance Web Developer :::
			Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers 
			
		SDLC 
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
			
		Process ::: 
			Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers - 6months
			
		Water-fall Model ---			Linear Approach.
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development ==> 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
		
		New CR : 
		
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development ==> 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
			
		Agile Methodilogies :::
		
			Modules / Iterations ::::
			Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers - 6months
		
		Module-1 / Iteration 1	
		
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development ==> 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
			
		Module-2 / Iteration 2	
		
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development ==> 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring		

		Module-3 / Iteration 3	
		
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Code & Development ==> 
			Testing 
			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
			
		
		3 Modules --> deployment 
		
		
		DevOps 
		
			Requirement Analysis

			Implementation / Deployments
			Maintainence - Enhancements/Monitoring
			
		
		Agile vs DevOps ::::
		
		Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers
		
		5 to 10 ???
		
		Application :::
		
			Monolith Application Architecture ===> 
			
			Micro-service based Architecture
			
			Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers
			www.amazon.com
			
			End-user ::
				
				Sign-up							Miroservice --> independently create/work on this, test & deploy to prod.
				Sign-In
				Search for products
				Add to cart
				Place the order 
				Make Payment
				Confirm Order
				Track order
				
				New Feature ---> independently create/work on this, test & deploy to prod.
				
				
		Developer !!!
		
		
		DevOps Strategy ::: 
			Why ???

		SDLC :::
		
			Business Analyst / Application Architects --
			
			Infra-Structure Team			-- 	Provision and configure the servers
			Development Team				--	Develop the code -- Coding...
			Testing Team 					-- 	Testing QA,UAT
			Release Management Team			-- 	Ensure the product release on time
			Production Support Team 		--	support the real appln.
			Production Monitoring Team 		-- 	Monitor the production servers & Applications running production envrionment
			
			Continuous Development 		--->> 
				developer1 -- java web application --> 		create the scr code - perform build - create artifacts - unit test.
								
								signup.jsp ==> build (Compile the src code & Create artifacts(binaries)*.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
												
				
								Using Eclipse based IDE for coding
								Visual Studio Code  IDE
								Visual Studio 
								Pycharm
			
			Environments ::::
			
			Non-Production Environment								Production Environment
			
				DEV	  - develop 											PROD  
				BUILD - build
				TEST
					QA 
					UAT 
					
			Continuous Integration   
				===> Automation of build (Compile the src code & Create artifacts(binaries) & integrate for testing
				
			Continuous Delivery
				
			Continuous Testing 				
			
			Continuous Deployment
			
			Continuous Monitoring
			
			Non-Prod 																			Prod Environment
			
			Build --> Created artifacts --> publised to QA --> publised to UAT 		---> 		Release to PROD Environment
			
			
			Continuous Delivery   --> Need Manual Approval for Prod Release 
			
			Continuous Deployment --> Automated Prod Release --> zero downtime Kubernetes
			
			
		Applications :::
		
			amazon
			facebook
			netflix ......
			
		Ins/finance domain
		
			DevOps Strategy :::
			
			Release any new feature/product 
			
			dependencies.
			
			create a deployment window ::: 4 - 6hrs
			
			Continuous Delivery
			

		Continuous testing ::
		
			Non-Prod 																			Prod Environment
			
			Build --> Created artifacts --> publised to QA --> publised to UAT 		---> 		Release to PROD Environment
			
			
			
		Finance Domain
		
		Telecomm Domain ;;
		
				SP1 -- decided to release any new product/offer/service to customers -- that shd be done ASAP.
				SP2 -- decided to release any new product/offer/service to customers -- that shd be done ASAP.	

Adhoc Request ::: eod: DEV,testing,rm -- need severs 
				
			test servers.
			
		Jenkins to automate... 	terraform, ansible...
			
			
			
			
		Continuous Monitoring	
		
			Create a E-Commerce website and host in web servers --- End-users are using this portal.
					No. of users   10000 users -- 20000 
					Infra-Structure - health status.
					Security attacks 
					
					
			Infra-Structure Monitoring --->  Promethus/Grafana
			
			Application Monitoring AppDynamics
			
			
		DevOps Architects
		DevOps Engineers

########
Day-2
########

			Lab Environment 
			Version Control System Using GIT.

		DevOps Tools :::
		
			Open-Source Tools ---> Self-Managed Tools 
			
				jenkins 
			
			DevOps Managed Services/Tools --- 
				AWS / Az / GCP 
				
				
		AWS Cloud Platform :::   				-- 	Free Tier Account! 12 Months.
			Virtual Machines ::::					EC2 Instances 
				Install all the devops tools. 	

		AWS free - tier account
		github.com
		dockerhub.com
		
		Visual Studio Code 
		MobaXterm/putty		-- SSH Client -- used to access Remote servers from our local machine.
		
		1. Create Github Account.
		2. 
		
		Repository 	-- Collection of Folders and files. 
					-- Version Control.
